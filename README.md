### Class/Interface Design, (Level - Hard)

1. Think of a scenario where you can design your classes and interfaces as in the diagram below:
![alt text](https://github.com/Infosys-Classes-2/NET-Classes-Bishnu/blob/main/CSharpFundamentals/AssignmentSolutions/ClassDiagram.png)

Also make sure,
>1. Base class 1 should have a method that can be overriden by child classes  
>1. Base class 1 should not allow its instantiation.
>1. Base class 2 should have a method that must be overriden by child classes1. 
>1. Child class 1 should have a method that hides a parent method.
>1. Child class 2 should have a propery that hides a property in a parent class.
>1. Child class 2 should have a method that is overriden and uses base class implementation of that method as well.
>1. Grand child should protect itself from getting inherited.
>1. Show case all the use-cases above in Main(). 

### Web development

1. Create new simple web app using mvc pattern, add two new actions in existing *Home* controller:
    1. First action should render bootstrap table with 10 rows
    1. Second action should render carosel with 5 images to slide.

1. Add new action on Test Controller and display multiplication table of 5 on its corresponding view.

2. Modify (2) to allow supplying a number (instead of fix 5) thorugh query parameter to get multiplication table for.

1. Add new action on some controller and supply array of 40 integers to its view. Let numbers be {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 23, 15, 24 etc} then display output in view as following:
    ```
    Output:
    All numbers: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 23, 15, 24 ...]
    Multiples of 3: [3, 6, 15 ...]
    Multiples of 4: [4, 8, 24 ...]
    Multiples of 5: [5, 15 ...]
    ```
