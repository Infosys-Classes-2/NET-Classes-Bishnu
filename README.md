Also make sure,
>1. Base class 1 should have a method that can be overriden by child classes  
>1. Base class 1 should not allow its instantiation.
>1. Base class 2 should have a method that must be overriden by child classes1. 
>1. Child class 1 should have a method that hides a parent method.
>1. Child class 2 should have a propery that hides a property in a parent class.
>1. Child class 2 should have a method that is overriden and uses base class implementation of that method as well.
>1. Grand child should protect itself from getting inherited.
>1. Show case all the use-cases above in Main().
